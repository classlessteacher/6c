<p>Parkinsons is a disability that the eldery get once they obtain a certain age. It cuases one limb to shake, this will mostly occor in the wrist joint. This will make it hard for these poeple to do basic daily activities.</p>
<h2>Our Product</h2>
<p>The P.A.B is an arm brace which allows people with parkinsons to stop shaking........</p>
<h2>How we got the idea</h2>
<p>As we were brain stroming for ideas we came up with the problem that people with parkinsons don't have a device which keeps them from shaking. So we had to fix that with the P.A.B.</p>
